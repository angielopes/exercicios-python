"""Create a program that allows managing the grades of a class of students.
It must offer the following options:
1. Add student:
    The user must provide the student's name and a list of 3 grades
    (using input and conversion to numbers).
    The student will be added to the list in the format
    ["Name", [grade1, grade2, grade3]].
2. Remove student:
    The user must provide the student's name to remove them from the list.
    If the student does not exist, display an informative message.
3. View a student's average:
    The user must provide the student's name, and the program calculates
    and displays the average of the grades.
4. List all students and their averages:
    The program displays all students in the list, showing their averages.
5. Exit the program."""
